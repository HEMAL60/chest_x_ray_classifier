# 🏥 Chest X-Ray Disease Classifier Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Description
This project employs deep learning models to classify diseases from chest X-ray images. Utilizing advanced CNNs and visual transformers, it aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging.

## 🔨 Installation
- Clone the repository.
- Install required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Ensure necessary hardware (GPU) for deep learning models.

## 🚀 Usage
- Upload chest X-ray images.
- The model classifies the image into one of the multiple diseases.
- Further information in the 'Usage' section.

## 📊 Dataset
Utilized the NIH Chest X-ray dataset. More details in 'Dataset' section.

## 🧬 Methodology
Incorporates CNN models and a visual transformer via transfer learning and ensembling techniques. Detailed methodology available in the project documentation.

## 🌐 Deployment
- Web application deployed using Docker, FastAPI, Streamlit, and Oracle Cloud.
- Docker containerizes the application for consistent deployment.
- Oracle Cloud provides robust, scalable hosting.
- Detailed deployment guide in 'Deployment' section.
